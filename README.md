# Object-Oriented-Program-H10

## Description
* Build a Node.js command-line application that takes in information about employees on a software engineering team, then generates an HTML webpage that displays summaries for each person. Testing is key to making code maintainable, so you’ll also write a unit test for every part of your code and ensure that it passes each test.

## Built with:
* .js
* node
* npm
* css
* html

## Usage:
* GIVEN a command-line application that accepts user input
* WHEN I am prompted for my team members and their information
* THEN an HTML file is generated that displays a nicely formatted team roster based on user input
* WHEN I click on an email address in the HTML
* THEN my default email program opens and populates the TO field of the email with the address
* WHEN I click on the GitHub username
* THEN that GitHub profile opens in a new tab
* WHEN I start the application
* THEN I am prompted to enter the team manager’s name, employee ID, email address, and office number
* WHEN I enter the team manager’s name, employee ID, email address, and office number
* THEN I am presented with a menu with the option to add an engineer or an intern or to finish building my team
* WHEN I select the engineer option
* THEN I am prompted to enter the engineer’s name, ID, email, and GitHub username, and I am taken back to the menu
* WHEN I select the intern option
* THEN I am prompted to enter the intern’s name, ID, email, and school, and I am taken back to the menu
* WHEN I decide to finish building my team
* THEN I exit the application, and the HTML is generated
